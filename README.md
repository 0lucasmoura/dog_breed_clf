Dog Breed Classifier using CNNs and Transfer Learning! This is the capstone project for the Deep Learning Engineer Nanodegree Course of Udacity!

Feel free to sugest changes and to comment on it!

### How to run everything?

[Make sure to have an aws account!](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)

Go to SageMaker and create a notebook instance. Make sure to select the clone the repository option before finishing the creation!

Just go to notebook 1-Data Analysis and run every cell. Then do the same with notebook 2!
